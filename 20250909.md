## Week in Ethereum News
### September 09, 2025

[See this newsletter in your browser](https://wie.ercref.org/blog/20250909/)

## Highlight of the Week

* Ethereum developers made significant progress on the Fusaka upgrade with client teams working to fix syncing issues in Devnet-3, as detailed in a [comprehensive bug tracker](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/fusaka-syncing-bugs) compiled by Barnabás Busa. Teams are targeting Monday for all code to be on trunk branches with near 100% participation recovery once fixes are deployed.

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

* [All Core Devs - Consensus (ACDC) #164, September 4, 2025](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-164-september-4-2025/25240/5):
  * Fusaka Devnet-3:
    * Multiple client issues identified across devnet with a comprehensive feedback document compiled
    * Recent fixes reported: Lighthouse bug(s) fixed on unstable branch, Prysm ready to use trunk, Teku still working on RPC issues
    * Next steps: Target Monday for all code on trunk branches, target near 100% participation recovery once fixes are deployed, run another non-finality test for 1-2 days to confirm fixes
  * Fusaka Devnet-5 planning:
    * Will launch with larger scale like Devnet-4
    * Launch contingent on successful Devnet-3
    * Broader Fusaka timeline depends on completing current bug fixes and successful Devnet-5 testing
  * Protocol Upgrade Process Timeline Changes:
    * Tim Beiko proposed [modifications to the original process document](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/pull/1715)
    * Key proposed changes: Minimum 14 days (down from 30) between client releases and first testnet, minimum 10 days between each testnet, maintain 30-day buffer between client releases and mainnet
    * Community feedback collected from L2s, LSTs, infrastructure providers who were mostly in favor
    * Outstanding concerns include mixed-use nature of testnets and need for clearer public feedback

* [All Core Devs - Execution (ACDE) #220, September 11, 2025](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-execution-acde-220-september-11-2025/25290/2) (upcoming):
  * Agenda includes discussions on Fusaka and Glamsterdam upgrades
  * Current Fusaka devnet: [fusaka-devnet-3](https://fusaka-devnet-3.ethpandaops.io/)

## Fusaka (Osaka + Fulu) upgrade

* Client teams are working to fix syncing issues in Fusaka Devnet-3, with a [comprehensive bug tracker](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/fusaka-syncing-bugs) compiled by Barnabás Busa from ethPandaOps
* Lighthouse reported that a major bug was resolved in its Unstable branch, while Teku continues to address RPC-related issues
* Developers are planning to launch Devnet-5 with approximately 1,500 nodes once Devnet-3 achieves stability with near 100% validator participation
* Tim Beiko proposed [modifications to the protocol upgrade process](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/pull/1715), reducing the buffer between client releases and first testnet from 30 to 14 days, and between testnets from two weeks to a minimum of 10 days
* A contract failure linked to the ModExp gas-cost increase under Fusaka testing was highlighted during the ACDC call

## Glamsterdam (Amsterdam–G-Star) Upgrade

* Developers made it clear that the next steps for Glamsterdam, particularly the selection and testing of EIPs, depend on Fusaka reaching mainnet
* This sequencing avoids the risk of handling two major forks simultaneously, with Fusaka acting as the gatekeeper milestone
* While Glamsterdam's adoption depends on Fusaka, preparation is still moving in parallel with teams continuing discussions, specifications, and prototyping of Glamsterdam EIPs
* No testnet or devnet cycles for Glamsterdam will start until Fusaka has been released

## Layer 1

* A [new research post](https://ethresear.ch/t/post-pectra-effects-on-ethereum-reorg-rate-propagation-and-block-size/23018) by the Decipher Research Team analyzed the impact of the Pectra upgrade on Ethereum, finding that:
  * Reorg rate decreased slightly, from 0.1224% to 0.1121% (approximately 10% lower)
  * Both blob propagation and block propagation times shifted downward, reducing the fraction of slots with delays near the 4s attestation boundary
  * Large blocks (>400 kB) are more likely to exceed 4s propagation
  * The frequency of such large blocks dropped after Pectra, especially due to EIP-7623
  * The average block size also decreased, mainly driven by EIP-7549, which reduced consensus-layer overhead by aggregating votes

* A [comprehensive analysis](https://ethresear.ch/t/ethereums-leaky-gas-tank-unveiling-13-costly-gas-model-inconsistencies/22989) by researcher hzysvilla identified 13 inconsistencies in Ethereum's gas model, including:
  * External transactions not incurring new-account charges when creating an account, while internal transactions do
  * Precompile calls sometimes skipping transaction input-byte fees
  * Access-list entries being charged even if never accessed
  * Self-transfers still charging transfer gas
  * Calldata vs. contract bytecode disk pricing mismatch
  * Reverted transactions being charged as if they wrote to disk

## Research

* [Ethereum's Leaky Gas Tank: Unveiling 13 Costly Gas Model Inconsistencies](https://ethresear.ch/t/ethereums-leaky-gas-tank-unveiling-13-costly-gas-model-inconsistencies/22989): Researcher hzysvilla published a detailed analysis of inconsistencies in Ethereum's gas model, with Vitalik Buterin noting that several issues are addressed by [EIP-4762](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4762), a companion EIP to statelessness that replaces current costs with a principled system based on charging for accessing pieces of storage not yet accessed during the same block.

* [Post-Pectra Effects on Ethereum: Reorg Rate, Propagation, and Block Size](https://ethresear.ch/t/post-pectra-effects-on-ethereum-reorg-rate-propagation-and-block-size/23018): The Decipher Research Team analyzed how the Pectra upgrade affected Ethereum's performance, finding that propagation times for both blocks and blobs decreased, leading to a slight reduction in reorg rates. The research also showed that EIP-7623 successfully shifted data load away from calldata, reducing the occurrence of very large blocks that are more likely to cause propagation delays.

* [Payload Chunking](https://ethresear.ch/t/payload-chunking/23008): A new research post exploring techniques for breaking down large payloads into smaller, more manageable chunks to improve data availability and statelessness in Ethereum.

* [Gossipsub's Partial Messages Extension and Cell Level dissemination](https://ethresear.ch/t/gossipsubs-partial-messages-extension-and-cell-level-dissemination/23017): A recent proposal for improving Ethereum's networking layer by enhancing the Gossipsub protocol with partial message extensions and cell-level dissemination to optimize data transfer.


## Layer 2

* [Arbitrum introduces DRIP](https://blog.arbitrum.io/author/entropyadvisors/) - The DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program (DRIP) launched on Arbitrum on September 3, 2025, aiming to boost DeFi activity and innovation across the ecosystem.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

* 🚨 [Lido at 24.06%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
* Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):
  * Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%
  * Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~42.71% & Prysm ~30.91%
  * Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.
* Better [geographic diversity](https://nodewatch.io/) is optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
