## Highlight of the Week

- The Fusaka upgrade testnet rollout has officially begun with the <a
  href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/09/26/fusaka-testnet-announcement"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Holesky testnet fork
  on October 1</a>, followed by scheduled deployments on Sepolia
  (Oct 14) and Hoodi (Oct 28). This major upgrade includes PeerDAS (Peer
  Data Availability Sampling) which will dramatically reduce Layer 2
  transaction costs and enable scaling to many more blobs per block over
  time.

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

- <a
  href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-execution-acde-222-october-9-2025/25624/2"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">All Core Devs -
  Execution (ACDE) #222, October 9, 2025</a>:

  - Fusaka update:

    - Sepolia Shadow Fork reported to be running smoothly with no missed
      blocks

    - Discussion on BPO schedule configuration and blob parameter
      consistency across clients

    - Client behavior regarding blob proof conversions at the fork
      boundary was reviewed

  - Scaling updates:

    - Ongoing work on state access benchmarks and investigation of slow
      blocks on mainnet

    - Updates on BlockNexis Access List (BAL) development with Besu,
      Geth, Reth, and Nethermind clients close to interop

  - Glamsterdam update:

    - Detailed discussions about Ethereum repricing efforts, including
      EIPs related to state growth and storage costs

    - Presentation on EIP-8032 (Tree-Depth-Based Storage Gas Pricing)
      and its implementation in Geth

    - Discussion on EIP-7791 (GAS2ETH) for on-chain payments

## Fusaka (Osaka + Fulu) upgrade

- <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/09/15/fusaka-audit-content"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Fusaka $2,000,000
  Audit Contest</a> is currently running and will end on October 13,
  inviting security researchers to find vulnerabilities in the upcoming
  upgrade.

- <a href="https://forkcast.org/upgrade/fusaka#eip-7892" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Blob Parameter Only (BPO)
  Hardforks</a> implementation is being tested on Holesky, creating a
  new lightweight process to adjust blob storage parameters without
  waiting for major upgrades, allowing Ethereum to make smaller, more
  frequent adjustments to blob capacity.

- <a href="https://forkcast.org/upgrade/fusaka#eip-7918" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Blob base fee bounded by execution
  cost</a> is being implemented to address blob fee market problems by
  introducing a reserve price tied to execution costs, preventing the
  blob fee market from becoming ineffective at 1 wei.

## Glamsterdam (Amsterdamâ€“G-Star) Upgrade

- <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@misilva/S1NxElHpgl" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Repricing EIPs</a> are being
  developed for Glamsterdam to harmonize costs across EVM operations and
  address scaling bottlenecks, including EIP-7904 (reducing compute
  prices), EIP-8037 (increasing state creation costs), and EIP-8038
  (adjusting state access costs).

## Layer 1

- <a href="https://forkcast.org/upgrade/fusaka#eip-7917" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Deterministic proposer lookahead</a>
  is being implemented to make Ethereum's block proposer schedule
  completely predictable ahead of time, improving reliability for
  preconfirmation protocols and MEV mitigation strategies.

- <a href="https://forkcast.org/upgrade/fusaka#eip-7934" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">RLP Execution Block Size Limit</a>
  is being added with a maximum size limit of 10MB to Ethereum blocks to
  prevent network instability and denial-of-service attacks, ensuring
  blocks stay within a reasonable size that the network can efficiently
  process and propagate.

- <a href="https://forkcast.org/upgrade/fusaka#eip-7825" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Transaction Gas Limit Cap</a> is
  being implemented with a 16,777,216 gas (2^24) cap for individual
  transactions, preventing any single transaction from consuming most of
  a block and ensuring fairer access to block space.
