---

The Ethereum community is preparing for the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, with a tight timeline targeting mainnet deployment in early November 2025 (before [Devconnect](https://devconnect.org/)). 

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

* [All Core Devs - Execution (ACDE) #216 (July 17, 2025)](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/allcoredevs-execution-acde-216-july-17-2025/24770/2):
  * Fusaka upgrade:
    * Devnet-2 is running stable with minor issues mainly from Consensus Layer clients.
    * Decision to remove [EIP-7907](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10026) (increase contract code size) from Fusaka due to complexity and timeline risks.
    * Client teams agreed to launch [devnet-3](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/fusaka-devnet-3) by July 23.
    * Timeline discussion for Fusaka targeting mainnet in early November (before Devconnect), with concerns about sufficient testnet stability and audit time.
  * Glamsterdam upgrade planning:
    * Execution Layer client teams favor [Block-Level Access Lists](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/block-level-access-lists/21195) paired with gas repricing.
    * Consensus Layer teams strongly favor [ePBS](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7732-the-case-for-inclusion-in-glamsterdam/24306).
    * FOCIL is popular but potentially conflicts with ePBS in implementation complexity.
    * Teams agreed to finalize headliners by August 21, with continued discussions in upcoming calls.

## Fusaka upgrade

* [EIP-7907](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7907) (increase contract code size) was [removed from Fusaka](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10026) during the ACDE #216 call due to significant unresolved complexity and timeline risks.
* [Fusaka-devnet-3](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/fusaka-devnet-3) is scheduled to launch by July 23, with client teams reporting stable progress on devnet-2 despite minor issues.
* The upgrade is targeting a tight timeline for mainnet deployment in early November 2025 (before [Devconnect](https://devconnect.org/)), requiring client releases by late August.

## Glamsterdam Upgrade

* Client teams are actively discussing potential headliners for the Glamsterdam upgrade, with preferences documented at [forkcast.org](https://forkcast.org/upgrade/glamsterdam#client-team-perspectives).
* Execution layer client teams favor [Block-Level Access Lists](https://forkcast.org/upgrade/glamsterdam#eip-7928) (BALs) with significant gas repricing to achieve meaningful scaling improvements.
* Consensus layer client teams strongly favor [ePBS](https://forkcast.org/upgrade/glamsterdam#eip-7732), with wide but not unanimous support.
* [FOCIL](https://forkcast.org/upgrade/glamsterdam#eip-7805) is popular but seen as potentially conflicting with ePBS in terms of implementation complexity and scope.
* Teams agreed to finalize headliners by August 21, with continued discussions in upcoming ACDE calls (July 31 & August 14).

## Layer 1

* A new research post titled ["The Glamsterdam equation"](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-glamsterdam-equation/22760) was published, exploring scaling approaches for the upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade.
* ["A practical proposal for Multidimensional Gas Metering"](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-practical-proposal-for-multidimensional-gas-metering/22668) was published, suggesting improvements to how gas is metered in the EVM to better reflect actual resource usage.
* ["Revisiting Secure DAS in One and Two Dimensions"](https://ethresear.ch/t/revisiting-secure-das-in-one-and-two-dimensions/22762) was shared, exploring improvements to data availability sampling techniques that will be critical for Ethereum's scaling roadmap.
* ["Block Constraints Sharing: Multi-Relay Inclusion Lists & beyond"](https://ethresear.ch/t/block-constraints-sharing-multi-relay-inclusion-lists-beyond/22752) was published, proposing mechanisms to improve censorship resistance in block building.

## Research

* **Multidimensional Gas Metering:**
  * ["A practical proposal for Multidimensional Gas Metering"](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-practical-proposal-for-multidimensional-gas-metering/22668) was published, building on previous research to propose practical implementations for more accurate resource pricing in the EVM.
  * This follows the earlier research ["Going multidimensional - an empirical analysis on gas metering in the EVM"](https://ethresear.ch/t/going-multidimensional-an-empirical-analysis-on-gas-metering-in-the-evm/22621) which provided empirical data on EVM resource usage.

* **Data Availability Sampling:**
  * ["Revisiting Secure DAS in One and Two Dimensions"](https://ethresear.ch/t/revisiting-secure-das-in-one-and-two-dimensions/22762) was published, exploring improvements to data availability sampling techniques that will be critical for Ethereum's scaling roadmap.

* **Rollups and Layer 2:**
  * ["Preemptive Provable Assertions"](https://ethresear.ch/t/preemptive-provable-assertions/22757) was shared, proposing a new approach to rollup sequencing.
  * Discussion continued on ["Native rollupsâ€”superpowers from L1 execution"](https://ethresear.ch/t/native-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-execution/21517), exploring how L1 execution capabilities could enhance rollup performance.

* **Cryptography and Privacy:**
  * ["BITE Protocol: On-Chain Decryption via Precompiled Contracts"](https://ethresear.ch/t/bite-protocol-on-chain-decryption-via-precompiled-contracts/22210) was discussed, proposing mechanisms for on-chain decryption operations.

## Layer 2

* [Arbitrum One TVL reaches $17.47B](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum), growing 12.2% over the past year as the leading Layer 2 solution continues to attract users and developers.

* [Base surpasses 124 UOPS](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/base) (user operations per second), showing a 15% increase in activity over the past week, cementing its position as the most active Layer 2 network.

* [Starknet activity jumps 34.8%](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/starknet) in the past week, as the ZK rollup continues to gain traction with developers building on its Cairo programming language.

* [Paradex sees 79.1% activity growth](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/paradex) in the past week, making it one of the fastest-growing Layer 2 platforms for decentralized derivatives trading.

## Stuff for Developers

* [Realtime Proving for L1 zkEVM announced](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/07/10/realtime-proving) by the Ethereum Foundation, marking the first step toward migrating to ZK proofs at all levels of the stack, from consensus layer signature aggregation to onchain privacy.

* [Partial history expiry now supported](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/07/08/partial-history-exp) by all Ethereum execution clients in accordance with EIP-4444, reducing disk space requirements by 300-500 GB by removing block data prior to the Merge.

* [EIP-7907 updated](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10007) to consider empty code as always warm, improving gas efficiency for contract interactions.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

* ðŸš¨ [Lido at 25.84%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
