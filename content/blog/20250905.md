## Week in Ethereum News
### September 05, 2025

[See this newsletter in your browser](https://wie.ercref.org/blog/20250905/)

## Highlight of the Week

* The Fusaka upgrade is making significant progress with [devnet-3 testing](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/fusaka-syncing-bugs), as client teams work to fix syncing issues and prepare for the next phase of testing. The upgrade, which includes PeerDAS for enhanced data availability, is targeting Q4 2025 for mainnet deployment.

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

* [All Core Devs - Consensus (ACDC) #164, September 4, 2025](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-164-september-4-2025/25240/5):
  * Fusaka devnet-3 progress:
    * Multiple client issues identified across devnet with comprehensive feedback document compiled
    * Recent fixes reported: Lighthouse bugs fixed on unstable branch, Prysm ready to use trunk, Teku still working on RPC issues
    * Next steps: Target Monday for all code on trunk branches, aim for near 100% participation recovery once fixes are deployed
  * Fusaka devnet-5 planning:
    * Will launch with larger scale like devnet-4
    * Launch contingent on successful devnet-3
  * Protocol Upgrade Process Timeline Changes:
    * Tim proposed [modifications to original process document](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/pull/1715)
    * Key proposed changes: Minimum 14 days (down from 30) between client releases and first testnet, minimum 10 days between testnet upgrades, maintain 30-day buffer between client releases and mainnet
    * Community feedback collected from L2s, LSTs, infrastructure providers who were mostly in favor
    * Outstanding concerns: Mixed-use nature of testnets, need clearer public feedback from community stakeholders

## Fusaka upgrade

* [PeerDAS](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7594) implementation progress continues with client teams working to fix syncing issues in devnet-3, as documented in a [comprehensive feedback document](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/fusaka-syncing-bugs)
* A new approach to improve blob propagation has been proposed with [Gossipsub's Partial Messages Extension](https://ethresear.ch/t/gossipsubs-partial-messages-extension-and-cell-level-dissemination/23017), which would allow for cell-level dissemination without requiring a hard fork
* [EIP-7823](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7823) (Set upper bounds for MODEXP) has moved to Review status, addressing potential consensus bugs by setting practical limits on cryptographic operations

## Glamsterdam upgrade

* The Glamsterdam upgrade planning continues with two headliner EIPs now scheduled for inclusion:
  * [EIP-7732](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732): enshrined Proposer-Builder separation (ePBS) for the consensus layer
  * [EIP-7928](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7928): Block-level Access Lists for the execution layer
* [EIP-7805](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7805) (Fork-Choice Inclusion Lists - FOCIL) has moved to "Considered for Inclusion" status, which would improve censorship resistance by empowering multiple validators to mandate specific transactions in each block

## Layer 1

* A [post-Pectra analysis](https://ethresear.ch/t/post-pectra-effects-on-ethereum-reorg-rate-propagation-and-block-size/23018) shows the upgrade has improved network performance with:
  * Reorg rate decreased by approximately 10% (from 0.1224% to 0.1121%)
  * Faster block and blob propagation times, with median max propagation time reduced by 126ms
  * Reduced block sizes, particularly from EIP-7549 which cut consensus data size by 70%
* [Generalized base fee update fraction](https://ethresear.ch/t/generalized-base-fee-update-fraction/22988) has been proposed as a way to improve Ethereum's fee market by making the base fee update mechanism more flexible

## Research

* Data Availability:
  * [Gossipsub's Partial Messages Extension](https://ethresear.ch/t/gossipsubs-partial-messages-extension-and-cell-level-dissemination/23017) proposes a way to make blob propagation faster and more efficient by allowing nodes to disseminate only the cells that are missing for a given row
  * A proof of concept implementation showed 10x less data being sent compared to full-column approaches

* Network Performance:
  * [Analysis of attestation timings in a 6-second slot](https://ethresear.ch/t/an-analysis-of-attestation-timings-in-a-6-s-slot/23016) examines how validators are performing with the current slot timing
  * [Payload Chunking](https://ethresear.ch/t/payload-chunking/23008) proposes improvements to data availability by breaking payloads into smaller chunks for more efficient propagation


## Layer 2

* [Optimism introduces Kona-Node](https://www.optimism.io/blog/introducing-the-kona-node-a-rust-powered-leap-for-the-op-stack), a modular, high-performance rollup node built entirely in Rust. Released in August 2025, this implementation offers memory safety, minimal resource footprint, and support for multiple proof backends like FPVM, SP1, and Risc0, all in just ~8K lines of code.

* [Optimism partners with Flashbots](https://www.optimism.io/blog/optimism-partners-with-flashbots) to bring fast, configurable, verifiable sequencing to the Superchain. The partnership aims to provide OP Stack builders with competitive advantages through sequencer innovation, including 200ms confirmation times and verifiable block building.

* [Silent Data joins Ethereum's Superchain](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/09/02/silent-data-becomes-first-privacy-focused-layer-2-to-join-ethereum-s-superchain/) as the first privacy-focused Layer 2 network. The project is one of over 30 layer-2 networks working to scale Ethereum while maintaining privacy guarantees for users.

## Stuff for Developers

* Foundry:
  * [Foundry v1.3.4 released](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/tag/v1.3.4) on September 3, 2025, as a bugfix release addressing version issues.
  * [Nightly build (2025-09-05)](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/tag/nightly-c732ea38473cc7cd5e169120c4fbe08e40c85ef8) includes updates to soldeer 0.7.0, fixes for transaction hash fetching documentation, and corrections to error messages for hex parsing.

* [ERC-8004: Trustless Agents](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-8004-trustless-agents/25098) proposal gaining traction with active discussion on Ethereum Magicians forum, providing a standard for autonomous agent interactions on Ethereum.

* [EIP-7997: Deterministic Factory Predeploy](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7997-deterministic-factory-predeploy/24998) proposal advancing with 12 responses in the past week, aiming to standardize contract deployment across chains.

## Security

* [Venus Protocol exploit and recovery](https://rekt.news/phished-founder-liquidated-thief): On September 4, 2025, the founder of Eureka Crypto fell for a malicious Zoom link, leading to a $13 million flash loan exploit on Venus Protocol. Venus responded by freezing the protocol, conducting an emergency governance vote, and force-liquidating the attacker's collateral, successfully recovering all funds within 12 hours.

* [Crypto hackers using Ethereum smart contracts to mask malware](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/04/crypto-hackers-are-now-using-ethereum-smart-contracts-to-mask-malware-payloads/): A new attack vector discovered where malicious actors use simple-looking smart contract code to fetch hidden URLs that direct compromised systems to download second-stage malware, making detection more difficult.

## Ecosystem

* [Ethereum Foundation announces HoleÅ¡ky testnet shutdown](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/09/01/holesky-shutdown-announcement) after the Fusaka upgrade. The testnet will be sunset two weeks after Fusaka finalizes, with infrastructure providers and staking operators expected to migrate to the Hoodi testnet launched in March 2025.

* [Ethereum Foundation to sell 10,000 ETH](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/09/02/ethereum-foundation-unloads-another-10k-eth-following-sharplink-deal/) via centralized exchanges over the coming weeks to support research & development, ecosystem grants, and donations.

* [Etherealize raises $40M](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/03/etherealize-raises-usd40m-to-bring-ethereum-to-wall-street/) to bring Ethereum to Wall Street, building on an earlier grant from Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation to develop institutional-grade Ethereum infrastructure.

* [Ethereum Foundation targets interoperability as top UX priority](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/08/29/ethereum-foundation-targets-interoperability-as-top-ux-priority/) in its latest strategic initiative. After years of focusing on scaling throughput and lowering costs, the protocol team is now prioritizing interoperability as the key to improving user experience.

## Notable at app layer

* [ArbitrumDAO launches DeFi Renaissance Incentive Program](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/03/arbitrumdao-incentivizes-defi-growth-with-24m-arb-token-rollout/) with a 24 million ARB token rollout. The first season of this $40 million program aims to drive DeFi growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem.

* [The Ether Machine receives $654M ETH investment](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/02/the-ether-machine-gets-usd654m-eth-investment-from-blockchains-jeffrey-berns/) from Blockchains' Jeffrey Berns. This commitment brings the company's ETH holdings to over $2.1 billion as it prepares to go public via a merger later this year.


## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

* ðŸš¨ [Lido at 24.06%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
* Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):
  * Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%
  * Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~42.71% & Prysm ~30.91%
  * Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.
* Better [geographic diversity](https://nodewatch.io/) is optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
