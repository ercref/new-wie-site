## Week in Ethereum News
### September 05, 2025

[See this newsletter in your browser](https://wie.ercref.org/blog/20250905/)

## Highlight of the Week

* The Fusaka upgrade development is progressing with significant focus on fixing client syncing issues in devnet-3. Multiple client teams have identified and addressed bugs, with a target of Monday, September 8 for all code to be on trunk branches, as discussed in the [ACDC #164 call](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-164-september-4-2025/25240/5).

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

* [All Core Devs - Consensus (ACDC) #164, September 4, 2025](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-164-september-4-2025/25240/5)
  * Fusaka devnet-3:
    * Multiple client issues identified across the devnet with a comprehensive [feedback document](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/fusaka-syncing-bugs) compiled by Barnabas
    * Recent fixes reported: Lighthouse bugs fixed on unstable branch, Prysm ready to use trunk, Teku still working on RPC issues
    * Next steps: Target Monday for all code on trunk branches, aim for near 100% participation recovery once fixes are deployed, run another non-finality test for 1-2 days to confirm fixes
  * Fusaka devnet-5 planning:
    * Will launch with larger scale like devnet-4
    * Launch contingent on successful devnet-3
    * Broader Fusaka timeline depends on completing current bug fixes and successful devnet-5 testing
  * Protocol Upgrade Process Timeline Changes:
    * Tim proposed [modifications](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/pull/1715) to the original process document
    * Key proposed changes: Minimum 14 days (down from 30) between client releases and first testnet, minimum 10 days between each testnet, maintain 30-day buffer between client releases and mainnet
    * Community feedback collected from L2s, LSTs, infrastructure providers who were mostly in favor
    * Outstanding concerns: Mixed-use nature of testnets, need for clearer public feedback, teams need more time to review proposal
  * Other discussions:
    * ModExp gas cost increase breaking a contract from AlignedLayer (discussion ongoing in Telegram)
    * Mario highlighted teams should check Hive test results
    * Reminder: Glamsterdam EIP discussions deferred until Fusaka mainnet release

## Stuff for Developers

* Foundry:
  * Released [v1.3.4](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/tag/v1.3.4) on September 3rd with important bugfixes.
  * Added support for [Sourcify API v2](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/11438) in `forge verify-contract` command.

  * Updated to [soldeer 0.7.0](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/11543) for enhanced dependency management.

* The Ethereum Foundation published [Protocol Update 003 â€” Improve UX](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/08/29/protocol-update-003) on August 29th, focusing on interoperability improvements through intent-based architecture and general message-passing to reduce latency and costs.

## Security

* Venus Protocol [recovered $13 million](https://rekt.news/phished-founder-liquidated-thief/) on September 4th after a founder of Eureka Crypto fell for a malicious Zoom link, leading to a flash loan exploit.

## Ecosystem

* The Ethereum Foundation announced on September 1st the [HoleÅ¡ky Testnet Shutdown](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/09/01/holesky-shutdown-announcement), with the network to be sunset two weeks after the Fusaka upgrade finalizes. Users are encouraged to migrate to the Hoodi testnet launched in March 2025.

* The Ecosystem Support Program shared [its next chapter](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/08/29/esp-next-chapter) on August 29th, revealing it awarded close to $3M in funding to 105 projects in 2024 alone, supporting developer tooling, data analytics, education, research, and community events.

## Notable at app layer

* Pascal is [building a clearinghouse for onchain finance](https://blog.arbitrum.io/how-pascal-is-building-the-clearinghouse-for-onchain-finance), as announced on September 4th, targeting the massive derivatives market that reached approximately $667 trillion at the end of 2023.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

* ðŸš¨ [Lido at 24.06%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
* Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):
  * Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%
  * Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~42.71% & Prysm ~30.91%
  * Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.
* Better [geographic diversity](https://nodewatch.io/) is optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.

## Client Releases

  * [Lighthouse v7.1.0](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases/tag/v7.1.0): Low-priority maintenance release with hierarchical state diffs for hot state (4x less disk I/O), optimized processing of Electra SingleAttestation messages, default gas limit of 45M, and light client updates broadcasting improvements.
  * [Prysm v6.0.4](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/releases/tag/v6.0.4): More work on PeerDAS, light client support, and bug fixes including blob cache size correction, slashing protection history exports fix, and API call corrections.

* Execution layer:
  * [Nethermind v1.33.1](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/releases/tag/1.33.1): Hotfix release addressing issues with eth_config and receipts handling, correcting an issue where receipts were being removed for blocks beyond TxLookupLimit even when History pruning was disabled.
