* The Ethereum core developers have finalized the headliners for the upcoming **Glamsterdam upgrade**, confirming [EIP-7732 (ePBS)](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7732) as the Consensus Layer headliner and [EIP-7928 (Block-Level Access Lists)](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7928) as the Execution Layer headliner, setting the foundation for the next major network upgrade after Fusaka.

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

* [All Core Devs - Execution (ACDE) #218, August 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/live/iPYHJnEeY9g):
  * Fusaka Devnet-4 progress:
    * Identified and addressed cross-client divergences in blob-fee calculation
    * Improved boot-node diversity to ensure robust peer discovery
    * Standardized fork-boundary rules for consistent client behavior
  * Fusaka timelines:
    * Postponed schedule decisions until Devnet-5 is stable
    * Tentative timeline includes Sepolia and Holesky client releases on September 8, 2025
  * Glamsterdam planning:
    * Confirmed ePBS (EIP-7732) and BAL (EIP-7928) as headliners
    * Dropped EIP-7778 (reducing slot times to six seconds) due to conflicts with BAL design
  * Testing improvements:
    * Strengthened testing discipline for major EIPs before ACD presentations
    * Implemented stress-testing for ModExp repricing and contract-size changes in Devnet-5

* [All Core Devs - Consensus (ACDC) #163, August 21, 2025](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-163-august-21-2025/25104):
  * This call is scheduled for August 21, 2025, and will continue discussions on Fusaka and Glamsterdam upgrades.

## Fusaka (Osaka + Fulu) upgrade

* [Fusaka Devnet-4](https://fusaka-devnet-4.ethpandaops.io/) launched on August 8, 2025, with a focus on testing blob throughput, validator behavior, and client stability under elevated load.
* The devnet experienced issues during Blob Parameter Only (BPO) 3 testing, with several execution layer and consensus layer clients facing challenges:
  * Erigon computed blob-fees incorrectly and forked away from other clients
  * Lighthouse and Nimbus faced difficulties in peer discovery due to limited boot-node diversity
* Developers implemented a phased [BPO rollout strategy](https://notes.ethereum.org/@jtraglia/fusaka_scheduling) to gradually increase blob capacity:
  * Fusaka starts with a target of 6 blobs and a max of 9
  * BPO1 raises the target to 9 and the max to 14
  * Subsequent phases follow an exponential pattern, ultimately scaling to a max of 72 blobs
* [Non-finality testing](https://dora.fusaka-devnet-3.ethpandaops.io/slot/106243) is being conducted to ensure clients can handle network instability gracefully, with three key test phases:
  * Simulating validator outages by taking down instances of each client
  * Throttling about 30% of the network by reducing bandwidth
  * Splitting the network into two chains and then merging them back

## Glamsterdam (Amsterdamâ€“G-Star) Upgrade

* [EIP-7732 (ePBS)](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7732) has been officially selected as the Consensus Layer headliner for Glamsterdam, bringing protocol-level separation of block proposing and building.
* [EIP-7928 (Block-Level Access Lists)](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7928) was confirmed as the Execution Layer headliner, making state access explicit on a per-block basis.
* [EIP-7805 (FOCIL)](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7805) remains under active review as a Considered For Inclusion (CFI) proposal, with developers recognizing its potential but requiring further testing.
* The [BAL specification](https://eipsinsight.com/eips/eip-7928) is being refined to include entries for reads such as `SLOAD`, balance checks, and static calls, adding approximately 50 kB per block to improve auditability.
* Community feedback on Glamsterdam headliners was gathered via [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/soliciting-stakeholder-feedback-on-glamsterdam-headliners/24885) and synthesized into a detailed [report](https://efdn.notion.site/Stakeholder-feedback-synthesized-247d9895554180048a8bd279a28798a1).

## Layer 1

* A new [Beacon API for blobs](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/546) has been proposed to decouple blob data access from other beacon node responsibilities, reducing processing load and allowing blob consumers to fetch only what they need.
* [Slot timing specification changes](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4476) are being implemented to replace hardcoded constants with slot timing components defined in basis points, enabling more flexible experimentation with different slot durations.
* Block propagation metrics have shown significant improvement, with blocks now consistently propagating in under 1 second, and the 95th percentile delay for attestations improving from 2.52 seconds to 1.85 seconds.
* The "Safe-Head" proposal is being discussed to better expose fast-confirmation information through APIs, with three approaches under consideration:
  * Repurposing the existing safe block tag to point to the fast-confirmed block
  * Adding a new field such as `fastConfirmedBlock` hash to the Engine API and JSON-RPC
  * Making the meaning of the safe block configurable per consensus-layer client

## Research

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

* ðŸš¨ [Lido at 25.84%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
* Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):
  * Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%
  * Consensus layer: Lighthouse 42.71% & Prysm 30.91%
  * Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.
* Better [geographic diversity](https://nodewatch.io/) is optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
