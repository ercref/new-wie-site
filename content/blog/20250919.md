* [Shibarium suffered a $3 million validator heist](https://rekt.news/shibarium-rekt/) when an attacker flash-loaned BONE to control 10 out of 12 validators, then signed fraudulent checkpoints to drain the bridge. Half the stolen funds were trapped by blacklists and staking locks.

* [Largest npm supply chain attack in history](https://rekt.news/npm-heist/) gave attackers control over packages with 2+ billion weekly downloads, but the crypto-stealer they deployed only netted $1,050 as it broke CI/CD systems and exposed itself.

## Ecosystem

* [American Express introduced blockchain-based 'Travel Stamps'](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/09/15/american-express-introduces-blockchain-based-travel-stamps/), bringing a major traditional financial institution deeper into the blockchain space.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

* ðŸš¨ [Lido at 24.06%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
* Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):
  * Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%
  * Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~42.71% & Prysm ~30.91%
  * Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.
* Better [geographic diversity](https://nodewatch.io/) is optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
