## Week in Ethereum News

### October 03, 2025

## Highlight of the Week

- The Fusaka upgrade is progressing with <a
  href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-166-october-2-2025/25573/2"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Holesky testnet
  successfully forking</a> on October 1, 2025. This major upgrade
  introduces PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling) and will include
  two Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks to gradually increase blob
  throughput after activation.

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

- <a

  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">All Core Devs -
  Consensus (ACDC) #166, October 2, 2025</a>:

  - Fusaka upgrade:

    - Holesky fork activation went well overall despite some turbulence

    - Participation dropped initially due to missed client updates

    - Unexplained participation drop below 66% later in day, then
      recovered

    - First Holesky BPO update scheduled at 2025-10-07 01:20:00 UTC

  - Glamsterdam upgrade:

    - Shifting focus back to Glamsterdam development now that Fusaka is
      moving towards mainnet

    - ePBS updates: No spec changes recently, adding tests

    - Only Teku has passing tests on main branch, Prysm has passing
      tests on separate branch

    - Other clients waiting for stable Fusaka before merging ePBS work

  - ePBS Trustless Payments:

    - Discussion on separating payload separation from trustless
      payments

    - Different stakeholder groups: core devs (scaling experts) vs
      ecosystem (builders/validators)

    - Different complexity profiles and ecosystem impact

    - Decision deferred - needs written trade-off analysis before next
      discussion

## Fusaka upgrade

  schedule announced</a> with Holesky forking on October 1, Sepolia on
  October 14, and Hoodi on October 28. Mainnet is targeted for December
  at the earliest.

- <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7892" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks</a>
  will gradually increase blob throughput after PeerDAS activation:

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

- 🚨 <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lido at 23.44%</a>, still too close
  to the <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">33.3% threshold</a>.

- Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):

  - Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%

  - Consensus layer: Lighthouse 42.71%

  - Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.

- Better <a href="https://nodewatch.io/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">geographic diversity</a> is
  optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
