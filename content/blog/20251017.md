  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Sepolia BPO1 coming
  next on October 21</a>, and a tentative mainnet date of December 3,
  2025 was discussed at the
  <a href="https://forkcast.org/calls/acdc/167" target="_blank"

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

- <a
  href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-167-october-16-2025/25679/2"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">All Core Devs -
  Consensus (ACDC) #167, October 16, 2025</a>:

  - Fusaka upgrade:

    - Testnets are progressing well with no major issues reported

    - Sepolia BPO1 (Blob Parameter Only) coming next at 2025-10-21
      03:26:24 UTC

    - Tentative mainnet timeline discussed: client releases by November
      3, 2025, and mainnet activation on December 3, 2025 (not yet
      confirmed)

    - The \$2 million Fusaka audit contest has concluded with no
      findings that would delay the upgrade

  - Blob APIs:

    - Discussion about recent changes to blob APIs that caused confusion
      among L2s

    - Concerns about blob retrieval under PureDOS, particularly for
      decentralized sequencers

  - Glamsterdam upgrade:

    - Trustless payments in ePBS discussion - team decided to keep the
      current design despite added complexity

## Fusaka (Osaka + Fulu) upgrade

- <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/10/15/fusaka-blob-update"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Ethereum Foundation
  published a blog post</a> addressing an important change in the Fusaka
  upgrade that affects blob transaction originators (e.g., L2s).
  EIP-7594 (PeerDAS) changes the format for proofs from blob proofs to
  cell proofs, which allows for downloading specific parts of blobs
  instead of whole blobs for data availability sampling.

  - L2s and other blob originators need to update their transaction
    sending code to create cell proofs

  - Some L2s noticed their deployments on Sepolia didn't work properly
    due to this change

  - Client libraries expose functionality to create these proofs via
    `ComputeCellsAndKZGProofs()`

- <a
  href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/09/26/fusaka-testnet-announcement"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Testnet
  activations</a> are proceeding as scheduled:

  - Holesky: October 1, 2025 (completed)

  - Sepolia: October 14, 2025 (completed)

  - Hoodi: October 28, 2025 (upcoming)

- Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):

  - Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%

  - Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~42.71% & Prysm ~30.91%

  - Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.
