* Concerns raised about [EIP-7825 (Transaction Gas Limit Cap)](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1629#issuecomment-3129387862) setting the limit at 16.8M gas, which could break existing applications that require more gas. Discussion ongoing about potentially increasing this to 30M gas.

* [PeerDAS validator count concerns](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1629#issuecomment-3136474892) being addressed with a proposal to [increase BALANCE_PER_ADDITIONAL_CUSTODY_GROUP from 32 to 128 ETH](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4477).

## Glamsterdam Upgrade

* [CFI EIP-7928: Block-level Access Lists](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10083) for Glamsterdam was mentioned in the ACDE #217 call, indicating progress on defining the scope of the next major upgrade after Fusaka.

* The [FOCIL Breakout #16 call](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/focil-breakout-16-july-29th-2025-14-00-utc/24942) included a presentation on [ePBS compatibility with FOCIL](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/epbs-focil-compatibility/24777), exploring how these two proposed Glamsterdam headliners could potentially work together.

* Active [community feedback](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/soliciting-stakeholder-feedback-on-glamsterdam-headliners/24885/5) collection on Glamsterdam headliners continues, with stakeholders providing input on which features should be prioritized.

## Layer 1

* Geth team identified and fixed an issue where nodes were [running out of memory during tracing](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-testing-acdt-46-july-28-2025/24889/5), causing node crashes and database corruption on BloatNet. The fix involves reworking tracing to use less memory.

* Peer discovery issues reported between Geth and Nethermind clients, with [investigation ongoing](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-testing-acdt-46-july-28-2025/24889/6) into potential problems with ENR exchange. The issue appears to have started about 5 days ago and is unrelated to the 45M gas limit.

* Sunnyside Labs reported progress on [large block size propagation tests](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-testing-acdt-46-july-28-2025/24889/5), running two testnets with regular transactions to monitor how larger block sizes affect network data propagation.

Core developers aim to release client binaries by September 1, with mainnet upgrade targeted for mid-November, just before Devconnect.

* [Transaction Gas Limit Cap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7987-transaction-gas-limit-cap-at-2-24/24746) debate intensifies as developers discuss whether to cap transactions at 16.8M gas or increase to 20M. The decision, which impacts DEX aggregators and other complex applications, will be finalized on August 4.

* [Block-Level Access Lists (BAL)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10083) has been Considered for Inclusion as the execution layer headliner for the Glamsterdam upgrade, with strong community consensus. Benchmarking between variants including/excluding read-locations is ongoing.

## Stuff for Developers

* Foundry:
  * [Foundry v1.3.0](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/tag/v1.3.0) released with significant performance improvements (up to 21.5% faster tests), built-in linter, time-based campaigns for invariant tests, coverage-guided fuzzing, table tests, and improved EIP-712 support.
  * New [cast pad](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/11152) command added for hex data padding in the nightly build.
  * Fixed [consistent handling of unresolved imports](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/11164) in forge.

* [Partial history expiry](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/07/08/partial-history-exp) has been delivered across all Ethereum execution clients, allowing nodes to drop pre-merge history and reduce disk space requirements by 300-500 GB.

* [Gas limit increase](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/07/29/checkpoint-5) to 45M has been successfully implemented, with the latest blocks now using the new limit. Testing teams are working on a path to progressively higher limits in the future.

## Security

* [Woo X exchange](https://rekt.news/woox-rekt/) lost $14 million in a phishing attack that compromised a team member's device, giving hackers access to wallets across multiple blockchains. This marks the third major security incident for the WOO ecosystem.

* [GMX V1](https://rekt.news/gmx-rekt/) experienced a $42 million exploit on July 9 via a cross-contract reentrancy vulnerability introduced by a 2022 bug fix. The attacker manipulated globalShortAveragePrices to inflate GLP pricing, but funds were later recovered in coordinated disclosure with a $5M bounty paid.

* [ArcadiaFi](https://rekt.news/arcadiafi-rekt/) lost $3.6 million when an attacker used crafted swapData to trigger arbitrary calls through a trusted rebalancer contract. The exploit hit during a pause cool down period, leaving ArcadiaFi unable to intervene before the funds were bridged out.

## Ecosystem

* [Ethereum celebrated its 10th anniversary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/07/30/ethereum-10-years) on July 30, marking a decade since the genesis block and mainnet launch. Over 100 ecosystem-led events took place across 6 continents, and the Ethereum Foundation hosted a livestream event featuring discussions with co-founders and ecosystem builders.

* [Lean Ethereum](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/07/31/lean-ethereum) vision unveiled by Justin Drake as a roadmap for the next 10 years, focusing on extreme performance with uncompromising security and decentralization. The plan includes upgrades across all three L1 sublayers: consensus, data, and execution.

* [Checkpoint #5](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/07/29/checkpoint-5) published, providing updates on Fusaka upgrade progress, Glamsterdam headliner discussions, gas limit increases, and history expiry implementation.

* [Glamsterdam upgrade](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/soliciting-stakeholder-feedback-on-glamsterdam-headliners/24885) headliner discussions continue, with stakeholder feedback being solicited. The consensus layer community is choosing between enshrined proposer-builder separation (ePBS) and delayed execution (EIP-7862).

## Notable at app layer

* [GENIUS Act](https://rekt.news/genius-or-gimmick/) introduced, potentially reshaping the regulatory landscape for stablecoins and DeFi protocols. Critics argue it may be Wall Street's victory disguised as crypto's win, forcing DeFi protocols into compliance boxes while traditional finance absorbs the innovation.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

* 🚨 [Lido at 25.84%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
* Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):
  * Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%
  * Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~42.71% & Prysm ~30.91%
  * Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.
* Better [geographic diversity](https://nodewatch.io/) is optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.

## Client Releases
