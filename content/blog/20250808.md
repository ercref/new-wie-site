## Week in Ethereum News
### August 08, 2025

## Highlight of the Week

* Ethereum researchers are exploring ways to reduce slot time with a new approach that separates LMD GHOST fork choice from finality. Vitalik Buterin [proposed](https://ethresear.ch/t/lmd-ghost-with-256-validators-and-a-fast-following-finality-gadget/22856) using a smaller set of ~256 validators for LMD GHOST as the primary "heartbeat" with a finalizing consensus mechanism trailing behind, potentially enabling faster block times without compromising security.

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

* [All Core Devs - Consensus (ACDC) #162](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-162-august-07-2025/24919/2), August 07, 2025

## Fusaka (Osaka + Fulu) upgrade

* Client teams are working on "Perfect PeerDAS" syncing issues, which were identified as a potential blocker for the Fusaka upgrade during the ACDC call. This involves ensuring nodes can efficiently sync and backfill data in the new PeerDAS system.

* Two competing BPO (Blob Parameter Only) schedules were proposed during the ACDC call:
  * A conservative approach with gradual increases
  * An accelerated timeline proposed by Alex Stokes to "move BPO1 to 24 Nov, BPO2 to 15 Dec, and BPO3 to 14 Jan" to reach higher throughput levels more quickly

* The Beacon API for blobs (PR [ethereum/beacon-APIs#546](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/546)) is being finalized, with feedback needed from L2s on response content (whether to include KZG commitments/versioned hash with blobs) and query parameters (indices vs. versioned hashes).

## Layer 1

* A detailed [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QNlJbwDirIFI1V9eKwZXciYtEKFnHRiwVJzo_gWZz3g/edit?usp=sharing) on slot timing optimizations was shared during the ACDC call, exploring ways to reduce the current 12-second slot time by restructuring how different components of a slot interact.

* Discussions around gas limit increases for the Fusaka upgrade continued, with testing focused on network stability at higher limits. The proposal to raise the EIP-7825 transaction gas cap to 30M was discussed during the ACDT call.

## Research

* **Consensus Optimization:**
  * Vitalik Buterin published a [research post](https://ethresear.ch/t/lmd-ghost-with-256-validators-and-a-fast-following-finality-gadget/22856) proposing a new approach to Ethereum's consensus that separates LMD GHOST fork choice (using ~256 validators) from finality (using all validators). This could enable faster block times without compromising security and provide more flexibility for consensus mechanism design.
  * In the discussion, Vitalik emphasized the importance of liveness over bounded availability, arguing that "it's better to give people some information about the future state of the chain (via an available chain) than no information at all (via stalling)" during periods when finality guarantees stop.

* **Block Propagation:**
  * Active discussions continued on the ["Faster block/blob propagation in Ethereum"](https://ethresear.ch/t/faster-block-blob-propagation-in-ethereum/21370) thread, exploring techniques to optimize how blocks and blobs are transmitted across the network to reduce latency and improve scalability.

* **FOCIL Implementation:**
  * Detailed implementation guides for FOCIL (First-Only Committee-based Inclusion Lists) in both consensus and execution layers were shared during the ACDC call:
    * [How to Implement FOCIL in the CL](https://hackmd.io/@jihoonsong/rJX-fxADxl)
    * [How to Implement FOCIL in the EL](https://hackmd.io/@jihoonsong/BJpcaudvex)
## Layer 2

## Security

* [Credix exploited for $4.5 million](https://rekt.news/credix-rekt) when an attacker compromised an admin account, minted worthless acUSDC tokens, and borrowed against phantom collateral before transferring funds to Ethereum.

* [ArcadiaFi lost $3.6 million](https://rekt.news/arcadiafi-rekt) when an attacker used crafted swapData to trigger arbitrary calls through a trusted rebalancer contract, draining user vaults during a pause cool down period.

## Ecosystem

* [BitMine's ETH holdings near $5B after latest purchase](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/08/11/bitmine-s-eth-holdings-near-usd5b-after-latest-purchase-bmnr-tops-big-names-in-trading-volume), with the company aiming to acquire 5% of all ether supply (worth around $25B at current prices).

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

* ðŸš¨ [Lido at 25.84%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
* Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):
  * Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%
  * Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~42.71% & Prysm ~30.91%
  * Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.
