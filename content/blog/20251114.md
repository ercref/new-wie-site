  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Ethereum core
  devs</a> concluded their November 13 All-Core-Devs call by certifying
  the successful deployment of BPO2 on the Hoodi testnet, approving
  EIP-8068 (neutral effective balance design) for the Glamsterdam fork,
  and committing to a mid-December consensus devnet for interop testing.

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">All Core Devs -
  Consensus (ACDC) #169, November 13, 2025</a>:

  - Fusaka updates: Successful deployment of BPO2 on Hoodie with no
    significant issues; high blob fees confirmed to be functioning as
    intended.

  - Glamsterdam discussions: Focused on ePBS implementation progress and
    non-headliner EIP selection.

  - FOCIL (Fork-Choice Inclusion Lists) discussions: Mixed opinions on
    whether to prioritize fork cadence or feature implementation, with
    concerns about delays impacting the scaling roadmap.

  - EIP decisions: Moving forward with EIP-8068 (Neutral effective
    balance design), deferring decision on EIP-8062, and further
    evaluating EIP-8061 and EIP-8071.

## Glamsterdam (Amsterdam–G-Star) Upgrade

  scoping discussions</a> are ongoing, with client teams publishing
  their preferences.

  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ACDC #169 call</a>
  included extensive discussions about FOCIL (EIP-7805) and its
  potential inclusion in the Glamsterdam fork.

- Concerns were raised about balancing technical and social
  considerations for FOCIL implementation, with some suggesting it
  should be given higher priority.

## Layer 1

- <a
  href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/community-feedback-on-non-headlining-features-in-glamsterdam/26410/3"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Community feedback on
  non-headlining features in Glamsterdam</a> was solicited, with
  suggestions to heavily use Declined for Inclusion for EIPs that don't
  significantly move the roadmap forward.

  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Delivering an
  impactful 2026</a> discussion emphasized that FOCIL shouldn't get
  pre-committed as a headliner for Heka-Bogotá, to avoid another Verkle
  situation.

## Research

- <a
  href="https://ethresear.ch/t/modeling-the-worst-case-parallel-execution-under-eip-7928/23418"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Modeling the
  Worst-Case Parallel Execution under EIP-7928:</a> Researchers analyze
  how EIP-7928’s proposed parallel execution model behaves under
  adversarial worst-case contention. Their findings highlight potential
  latency and resource-usage spikes that client teams must account for
  when implementing multicore execution.

  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Synchronous
  Composability vs. Intents:</a>  
  Compares two competing approaches for cross-rollup interoperability:
  synchronous atomic calls vs. intent-based asynchronous flows. It
  outlines design trade-offs relating to UX, safety, and rollup
  independence, with researchers highlighting open problems around
  fallback and recovery logic.

## Layer 2:

  class="decorated-link" target="_new" rel="noopener">Starknet launches
  Privy-powered embedded wallets</a> on mainnet, enabling email/social
  login and smart-contract wallets for dapps. This lowers onboarding
  friction significantly and gives developers a native, AA-compatible
  wallet stack out of the box.

  MarketCore + RISEx</a>, shifting toward shared onchain markets infra
  and launching a native perps DEX. The move repositions RISE as a

## Stuff for Developers:

- <a href="https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/releases"
  class="decorated-link" target="_new" rel="noopener">Hardhat v3.0.13</a>:
  Bug-fix release focusing on more accurate gas statistics and
  improvements to the Rust-based Ethereum Development Runtime (EDR),
  tightening the feedback loop when profiling contract execution.

- <a
  href="https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/tag/nightly-ac00e0bb33fcc72f2554a41564cff659c2a8c90b"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nightly</a>:
  Introduces a new “browser wallet” feature plus docs and anvil
  refactors that lean more heavily on Alloy’s block/header types. This
  is an early step toward smoother browser-based integrations with
  Foundry, so front-end teams can eventually hook more directly into
  Foundry tooling.

  class="decorated-link" target="_new" rel="noopener">Positions in Uniswap
  v3</a>: Detailed walkthrough of how Uniswap v3 tracks liquidity as
  non-fungible “positions” keyed by owner + tick range, with concrete
  Solidity examples around the `positions` mapping and `mint` function.
  This is a good reference if you’re building LP tooling, analytics, or
  custom position managers and want to reason precisely about how ticks,
  fees, and liquidity are stored.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

- 🚨 <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lido at 23.54%</a>, still too close
  to the <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">33.3% threshold</a>.

- Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):

  - Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%

  - Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~43% & Prysm ~31%

  - Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.

- Better <a href="https://nodewatch.io/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">geographic diversity</a> is
  optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
