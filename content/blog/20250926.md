## Highlight of the Week

- **Fusaka upgrade testnet schedule announced**: The Ethereum core developers have [finalized the testnet schedule](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-execution-acde-221-september-25-2025/25424/2) for the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, with Holesky forking on October 1, followed by Sepolia on October 16, and Hoodi on October 30. Mainnet deployment is expected in December at the earliest, bringing significant improvements including PeerDAS for enhanced data availability.

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

- [All Core Devs - Execution (ACDE) #221, September 25, 2025](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-execution-acde-221-september-25-2025/25424/2):
  
  - Fusaka upgrade:
    
    - Testnet schedule confirmed with Holesky forking first (Oct 1), followed by Sepolia and Hoodi every two weeks.
    - Client teams are preparing releases for testnets, with most expected by Monday.
    - All Fusaka EIPs are being moved to Last Call status, with [PR tracker available](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10423).
  - Mainnet gas limit:
    
    - Clients will update their default gas limit to 60M as part of Fusaka mainnet releases.
  - Glamsterdam upgrade:
    
    - EPBS and BAL breakouts continuing, with BAL devnet-0 expected in October.
    - Deadline for EIP PFI proposals set to coincide with Fusaka mainnet releases.
    - Proposal to [formalize the role of EIP champions](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10391) discussed.

## Glamsterdam (Amsterdamâ€“G-Star) Upgrade

- [EIP Champion role formalization proposed](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10391) to improve coordination and communication for EIPs included in network upgrades, with the Protocol Support team offering to identify champions for existing EIPs.
- [BAL devnet-0 expected in October](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-execution-acde-221-september-25-2025/25424/2), with client teams including Besu, Geth, and Nethermind already working on Block-level Access Lists (BAL) implementations.
- [EPBS breakout continuing](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-execution-acde-221-september-25-2025/25424/2) with development progressing on the Proposer-Builder Separation protocol, a key component of the Glamsterdam upgrade.

## Layer 1

- [Mainnet gas limit increase to 60M](https://blockworks.co/news/fusaka-rollout-glamsterdam) confirmed to be included in Fusaka mainnet client releases, significantly increasing Ethereum's transaction throughput capacity.

## Research

- [BALs for Proposer Commitments](https://ethresear.ch/t/bals-for-proposer-commitments/23095) explores using Block-level Access Lists to optimize proposer commitments, potentially improving the efficiency of preconfirmation protocols.
- [The Difficulty of Delayed Encryption Anti-MEV](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-difficulty-of-delayed-encryption-anti-mev/23087) analyzes challenges in implementing delayed encryption as an MEV mitigation strategy, highlighting potential vulnerabilities and implementation complexities.

## Layer 2

- [UXLink exploit](https://rekt.news/uxlink-rekt) led to an estimated $41 million loss after admin privileges were compromised, followed by cross-chain laundering and billions of UXLINK tokens being minted. The team has proposed a new contract with a 1:1 swap and plans to freeze hacker funds.

## Stuff for Developers

- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/tag/nightly-954accf6d7dcecd69ac62754d5f1911281a9ae15) released several updates this week including:
  
  - Added a new cast command `b2e-payload` to convert beacon payload to execution payload
  - Fixed formatter for hex literals with underscores
  - Added documentation for `cast rpc --decode-internal`
  - Updated to soldeer 0.7.1
- [OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.5.0-rc.0](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v5.5.0-rc.0) was released with several new features:
  
  - ERC6909 and its extensions are no longer marked as draft since EIP-6909 is now final
  - Added `SignerWebAuthn` for verifying WebAuthn signatures
  - Added `ERC7786Recipient` for cross-chain message handling
  - Added `InteroperableAddress` library for ERC-7930 interoperable addresses
  - Added several utility libraries including `Base58`, `Accumulators`, and `WebAuthn`

## Security

- [New Gold Protocol lost $2 million](https://rekt.news/newgold-protocol-rekt) shortly after launch due to price oracle vulnerabilities and broken transfer logic. The team went silent while security firms analyzed the exploit.
- [MYX Finance](https://rekt.news/parabolic-mirage) was found to be engaging in one of the largest airdrop Sybil attacks ever, with sophisticated market manipulation including wash trading with billions in fake volume and coordinated short squeezes.

## Ecosystem

- [Ethereum World's Fair districts announced](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/09/18/ethereum-worlds-fair) for the upcoming event in Buenos Aires this November, designed to showcase current innovations and future developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.
- [$1.9B inflows into Ethereum & Bitcoin ETFs](https://decrypt.co/340690/bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-drew-1-9-billion-assets-rate-cut-optimism): Institutional capital pours into ETH/ BTC as rate cut optimism fuels demand.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

- ðŸš¨ [Lido at 24.06%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
- Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):
  
  - Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%
  - Consensus layer: Lighthouse 42.71% & Prysm 30.91%
  - Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.
- Better [geographic diversity](https://nodewatch.io/) is optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.

## Client Releases

- Execution layer:
  
  - [Geth v1.16.4](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.16.4): enables the Osaka (Fusaka) fork on testnets, introduces two blob-parameter only (BPO) forks, and sets the default block gas limit to 60M gas.
  - [Nethermind v1.34.0](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/releases/tag/1.34.0): implements Osaka testnet forks, fixes snap sync edge cases, and improves stability with better cancellation handling.

  - [EIP-7935](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/commit/0d05178bf2e5edb245076bf7167a5d62b7ce23d0): Default gas limit to 60M, Moved to Review
  - [EIP-7892](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/commit/3e409e045791483c98c0e884802df7c64c3035a9): Blob Parameter Only Hardforks, Moved to Review
