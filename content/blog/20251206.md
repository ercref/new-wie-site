### December 06, 2025

## Highlight of the Week

- The <a href="https://forkcast.org/upgrade/fusaka/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Fusaka upgrade</a> successfully
  activated on Ethereum mainnet on December 3, 2025, bringing PeerDAS
  for enhanced data availability and several other improvements.
  However, the upgrade was followed by
  <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/Qcl9AZy6SiWAoTCSwDUTJg"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">some issues</a>,
  most notably a participation drop affecting Prysm nodes.

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

- <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1808" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">All Core Devs - Execution (ACDE)
  #225, December 4, 2025</a>

  - Fusaka post-upgrade: Discussion of
    <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/Qcl9AZy6SiWAoTCSwDUTJg"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">incidents following
    the fork</a>, including the Prysm participation drop and other minor
    issues.

  - Glamsterdam upgrade: Continued discussion of
    <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@ansgar/glamsterdam-el-pfi-eips"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">CFI/DFI candidate
    EIPs</a> for the next upgrade.

  - Housekeeping: Confirmed cancellation of ACDC call on December 25,
    and discussed whether to keep the ACDE call on January 1.

  - FOCIL status: Temperature check on whether FOCIL should be included
    in Heka/Bogotá as CFI or SFI.

## Fusaka Upgrade

- The <a href="https://forkcast.org/upgrade/fusaka/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Fusaka upgrade</a> successfully
  activated on Ethereum mainnet on December 3, 2025, at epoch 411392
  (slot 13164544).

- Post-upgrade
  <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/Qcl9AZy6SiWAoTCSwDUTJg"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">issues were
  reported</a>, most significantly:

  - Prysm participation drop: Prysm nodes were halted due to stale
    attestations triggering generation of older states. The solution was
    to restart nodes with a config flag, and the network began
    recovering quickly after the issue was identified.

  - Missing data in Dasmon: Probing showed many reports of missing data,
    possibly caused by late blob deliveries.

  - Nethermind bug with Nimbus: Nethermind reported a wrong invalid
    block at slot 13164552 when running with Nimbus CL.

  - Late delivery reorgs: Some blocks arrived late but still became
    canonical due to fork choice evaluation.

  - Reth bugs: Several issues were reported that may be related to the
    Fusaka upgrade.

## Layer 1

- <a
  href="https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1808#issuecomment-3610506249"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Client diversity
  concerns</a> were raised during the ACDE call, with data showing
  Lighthouse at 42.71% and Prysm at 30.91% of consensus clients, while
  Geth represents 41% of execution clients.

- <a
  href="https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1808#issuecomment-3612160094"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">EIP-7708: ETH
  transfers emit a log</a> received advocacy for inclusion in the next
  Ethereum upgrade to simplify the ability to query ETH value updates
  from transactions with just a vanilla Ethereum node.

- <a
  href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/3-paradigms-for-state-creation-repricing"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">State creation
  repricing approaches</a> were summarized by Anders Elowsson, outlining
  three paradigms: Repricing, Metering, and Targeting.

## Research

- <a
  href="https://ethresear.ch/t/threshold-encrypted-mempools-with-mev-commit-preconfirmations/23588?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
  class="decorated-link" target="_new" rel="noopener">Threshold Encrypted
  Mempools with mev-commit Preconfirmations</a> introduces a combined
  Shutter + mev-commit design for frontrunning-resistant encrypted
  mempools. Builders commit blindly and are slashable if they fail to
  include transactions once decrypted. A live testnet demonstrates the
  design, with future work aimed at eliminating plaintext exposure at
  RPCs.

- <a
  href="https://ethresear.ch/t/framework-for-altda-secure-integration-on-ethereum/23591?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
  class="decorated-link" target="_new" rel="noopener">AltDA Integration
  Framework</a> formalizes how rollups should verify external DA
  networks safely. It identifies commitment-binding, deterministic
  decoding, and DAV correctness as critical safety pillars. The post
  highlights timing attacks and proposes explicit recency checks to
  prevent data-withholding halts.

- <a
  href="https://ethresear.ch/t/proposal-a-continuous-verifiable-reality-cvr-framework-for-reducing-rwa-collateral-risk-weights/23577?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
  class="decorated-link" target="_new" rel="noopener">Continuous
  Verifiable Reality (CVR)</a> outlines a system for continuously
  validated off-chain collateral using staked oracle networks. It
  introduces a “verification discount” that could significantly reduce
  Basel-style risk weights. The post models real capital-efficiency
  gains for stable RWA-backed credit.

- <a
  href="https://ethresear.ch/t/zk-secret-santa-protocol/23582?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
  class="decorated-link" target="_new" rel="noopener">ZK Secret Santa
  protocol</a> uses ZKPs and nullifiers to privately match participants
  without revealing pairings. Its Sparse Merkle Tree registry ensures
  uniqueness and prevents double participation. Researchers frame it as
  a testbed for private governance, matching, and airdrops.

## Layer 2

- <a
  href="https://www.starknet.io/blog/native-usdc-live-on-starknet/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Native USDC and CCTP
  go live on Starknet.</a> Starknet announced that Circle’s native USDC
  and Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol are now live, giving the L2 direct
  issuance of regulated USDC plus canonical bridging to 18+ chains
  without wrapped tokens.

- <a href="https://ethereum.org/roadmap/fusaka/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Fusaka makes L2 data
  cheaper and denser.</a> The Fusaka upgrade activated on December 3,
  introducing PeerDAS (EIP-7594) so validators only sample a fraction of
  blob data while still guaranteeing availability, which BeInCrypto
  notes enables up to an 8x effective scalability boost for rollups by
  expanding blob bandwidth.

## Security

- Yearn Finance <a href="https://rekt.news/yearn-rekt3/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">suffered its third exploit</a> with
  \$9 million drained from a forgotten yETH pool due to an unchecked
  arithmetic underflow in legacy code.

  to L1 performance, increased blob throughput, and enhanced user
  experience.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

- 🚨 <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lido at 24.41%</a>, still too close
  to the <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">33.3% threshold</a>.

- Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):

  - Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%

  - Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~57.61% & Teku ~14.26%

  - Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.

- Better <a href="https://nodewatch.io/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">geographic diversity</a> is
  optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
