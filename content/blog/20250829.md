* [Generalized base fee update fraction](https://ethresear.ch/t/generalized-base-fee-update-fraction/22988): Proposal for improving the base fee update mechanism
* [SCOPE - Synchronous Composability Protocol for Ethereum](https://ethresear.ch/t/scope-synchronous-composability-protocol-for-ethereum/22978): New protocol for enabling synchronous composability across Ethereum

## Layer 2

* [Protocol Update 003](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/08/29/protocol-update-003) focuses on improving UX across the Ethereum ecosystem, with interoperability identified as the highest leverage opportunity. The EF's Protocol team is concentrating on intent-based architecture and general message-passing to drive down latency and cost.

* The Ethereum Foundation website was [updated on August 27, 2025](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/) with refreshed Layer 2 information, emphasizing the network of networks approach and how L2s provide $0.003 average transaction costs compared to $0.26 on mainnet.

## Stuff for Developers

* [Solidity 0.8.30](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2025/05/07/solidity-0.8.30-release-announcement/) was released, introducing `prague` as the new default EVM version along with NatSpec documentation improvements for enum values in the AST.

* The Ethereum Foundation's [Protocol Update 002](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/08/22/protocol-update-002) outlines their approach to blob scaling, which is critical for L2 data availability. The update details incremental changes to Ethereum's blob architecture to accelerate scaling for use cases like real-time payments, DeFi, social media, and AI applications.

* The [Trillion Dollar Security project](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/08/20/trillion-dollar-sec-2) entered Phase 2, focusing primarily on UX security issues. The initiative is launching a combination of high-leverage short-term actions and long-term projects targeting crucial areas in UX security.

* The EF Protocol team [announced](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/08/15/protocol-ama) a Reddit AMA scheduled for August 29th, 2025, providing developers an opportunity to engage directly with core contributors about ongoing protocol development work.

## Security

* [BetterBank lost $5 million](https://rekt.news/betterbank-rekt) on August 28th due to a reward logic flaw in their protocol. The exploit occurred just three weeks after launch, demonstrating how quickly incentive design flaws can lead to catastrophic losses.

* A sophisticated [AI-based attack](https://rekt.news/invisible-prompts) was reported on August 22nd, where developers were compromised through fake Solidity extensions. The attack used prompt injection techniques to manipulate AI assistants into moving ETH.

* [Coinbase lost $550K](https://rekt.news/drained-by-design) on August 20th after granting ERC-20 approvals to 0xProject's permissionless Settler contract. An MEV bot exploited these permissions to drain hundreds of tokens.

* Turkish cryptocurrency exchange [BTCTurk suffered a $51.7 million breach](https://rekt.news/btcturk-rekt) on August 19th due to a private key leak, marking their second major security incident after losing $55 million in June 2024.

* [Odin.fun lost $7 million](https://rekt.news/odin-fun-rekt) on August 12th through basic AMM manipulation, their third breach in six months despite having a PhD founder.

## Ecosystem

* The Ethereum Foundation [celebrated Ethereum's 10th anniversary](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/07/30/ethereum-10-years) on July 30th, marking a decade since the genesis block and mainnet launch.

* The [Ecosystem Support Program announced](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/08/29/esp-next-chapter) its next chapter on August 29th. In 2024 alone, ESP awarded close to $3M in funding to 105 projects through their open grants program, supporting work in developer tooling, research, community building, infrastructure, and open standards.

* The US Treasury's proposed [KYC requirements for DeFi](https://rekt.news/fork-in-the-code) have sparked debate, with an October 17th comment deadline that could significantly impact the future of permissionless finance. Some protocols may already have infrastructure like admin keys and blacklist functions that could be repurposed for compliance.

## Notable at app layer

* [Credix lost $4.5 million](https://rekt.news/credix-rekt) on August 5th when a compromised admin account minted worthless acUSDC tokens, borrowed against phantom collateral, and transferred the funds to Ethereum.

* [Arkham Intelligence uncovered](https://rekt.news/the-one-that-got-away) that 127,426 BTC (worth $14.8 billion at current prices) vanished from LuBian's mining pool in 2020, making it one of the largest single-event crypto thefts that remained undetected for years.

* [WOO X exchange lost $14 million](https://rekt.news/woox-rekt) on July 28th due to a phishing attack that compromised a team member's device, giving hackers access to wallets across multiple blockchains. This marks the third major security incident for the WOO ecosystem.


## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

* 🚨 [Lido at 25.84%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
* Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):
  * Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%
  * Consensus layer: Lighthouse 42.71% & Prysm 30.91%
  * Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.
* Better [geographic diversity](https://nodewatch.io/) is optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
