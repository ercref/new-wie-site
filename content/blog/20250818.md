## Week in Ethereum News
### August 18, 2025

## Highlight of the Week

* The Ethereum core developers have confirmed [EIP-7732 (ePBS)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732) and [EIP-7928 (Block-Level Access Lists)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7928) as the headliners for the upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade, setting the foundation for significant protocol improvements in 2026.

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

* [All Core Devs - Execution (ACDE) #218](https://www.youtube.com/live/iPYHJnEeY9g?t=137s) focused on Fusaka and Glamsterdam upgrades:
  * Fusaka: Issues in devnet-4 warrant a new devnet-5 to test fixes with no other spec changes
  * Glamsterdam: ePBS and Block-level Access Lists (BALs) confirmed as headliners
  * FOCIL remains CFI'd (Considered for Inclusion), with decision pending until ePBS & BALs are live on devnets
  * Deadline for other EIP PFI proposals extended to when Fusaka mainnet releases are published

* [FOCIL Breakout #17](https://www.youtube.com/live/H0RcZa5h8GM?t=247s) discussed:
  * FOCIL rebase onto Fulu and ePBS
  * FOCIL testing strategies
  * [Summary available](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1676#issuecomment-3182994108) with detailed implementation progress

## Fusaka upgrade

* [Fusaka devnet-4](https://fusaka-devnet-4.ethpandaops.io/) encountered several issues:
  * Erigon computed blob-fee incorrectly, causing it to fork away from other execution clients
  * Lighthouse and Nimbus struggled with peer discovery and sync due to poor boot-node diversity
  * A new devnet-5 is being prepared to test fixes before proceeding with the upgrade timeline
  * Client teams are implementing a new eth_getChainConfig JSON-RPC method to expose fork-ID configuration

* [BPO Update-Fraction Calculation](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1652#issuecomment-3187856880) decision made:
  * When base-fee update fraction changes at a fork, use the fork parameters of the current block, not the parent
  * This resolves inconsistency that triggered the DevNet-4 fork
  * Static tests will be published to ensure all clients implement the same logic

* [EIP-7883 (ModExp Gas Cost Increase)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7883) will triple the cost of the MODEXP precompile in Fusaka to prevent it from becoming a throughput bottleneck

* [EIP-7907](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7907) will raise the maximum contract size to 48 KB (doubling from current 24 KB) and remove the requirement to maintain a global "warm index" for contract code

## Glamsterdam upgrade

* [EIP-7732 (ePBS)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732) - enshrined proposer-builder separation - confirmed as the consensus-layer headliner for Glamsterdam

* [EIP-7928 (Block-Level Access Lists)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7928) confirmed as the execution-layer headliner with several specification decisions made:
  * State-read locations will remain in the BAL spec despite increasing size (~50 kB per block)
  * RLP will be used for encoding instead of SSZ due to limited Go-SSZ library support
  * System contracts: pre-execution changes will be recorded at index 0 and post-execution changes at the end of the list

* [EIP-7778 (6-second slots)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7778) was removed from Glamsterdam consideration due to conflicts with Block-Level Access Lists

* [EIP-7702 (Fossil)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) remains CFI and will be revisited only after ePBS and BAL implementations are stable

* Initial Glamsterdam timelines discussed: CL teams estimate ePBS implementation work converging around March/April 2026; FOCIL would add 1-2 months

## Layer 1

* [Safe-head proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1624#issuecomment-3088955383) presented by Mikael Kalinin with options for fast-confirmation exposure:
  * Repurpose existing safe block tag to point to fast-confirmed block
  * Add a separate fastConfirmedBlock hash to the Engine API and JSON-RPC
  * Make the meaning of the safe block configurable per CL client
  * Feedback requested from data providers via Eth R&D Discord (#execution-specs)

* [Max blobs per transaction](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/fusaka-devnet-4) set at 6 blobs per transaction in the PeerDAS API; the max-per-tx limit will be removed from the BPO schedule to simplify client logic

* [Base-fee update fraction](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1652#issuecomment-3187856880) remains in the BPO schedule; removing it would limit future flexibility and require extra mapping between BPOs and fork constants

## Research

* [A practical proposal for Multidimensional Gas Metering](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-practical-proposal-for-multidimensional-gas-metering/22668) explores ways to price different computational resources (memory, storage, bandwidth) separately to improve efficiency and prevent DoS attacks.

* [LMD GHOST with ~256 validators and a fast-following finality gadget](https://ethresear.ch/t/lmd-ghost-with-256-validators-and-a-fast-following-finality-gadget/22856) by Vitalik Buterin proposes a new approach to consensus with a smaller validator set for faster block confirmations.

* [Integrating 3SF with ePBS, FOCIL, and PeerDAS](https://ethresear.ch/t/integrating-3sf-with-epbs-focil-and-peerdas/22909) examines how the Three-Slot Finality (3SF) proposal could work with upcoming protocol changes.

* [The Glamsterdam equation](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-glamsterdam-equation/22760) analyzes the relationship between various protocol parameters in the upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade.

* [Overclocking Blocks with Gas Refunds](https://ethresear.ch/t/overclocking-blocks-with-gas-refunds/22862) proposes a mechanism to increase block efficiency by incentivizing state cleanup operations.

## Notable at app layer

* [Centrifuge surpasses **$1 billion in TVL**](https://thedefiant.io/news/tradfi-and-fintech/centrifuge-surpasses-usd1-billion-in-tvl-as-broader-rwa-heats-up) as the broader real-world asset (RWA) sector continues to gain momentum in DeFi.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

* ðŸš¨ [Lido at 25.84%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
* Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):
  * Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%
  * Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~42.71% & Prysm ~30.91%
  * Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.
* Better [geographic diversity](https://nodewatch.io/) is optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
