  - Execution (ACDE) #223, October 23, 2025</strong></a>:

  - Fusaka upgrade:

    - Sepolia BPO1 recap showed successful implementation with no major
      issues

    - Tentative mainnet dates were proposed: client releases on November

      one week, actual EIP and proposal merged within two weeks

    - Client teams to provide lists of EIPs and opinions by November 6
      to help prioritize proposals

    - Discussed two potential solutions for addressing rounding errors
      in gas pricing: a 1000x rebase of all gas values and a fractional
      gas proposal

    - Decided to remove EIP-7667 and EIP-6873 from the PFI (Proposed for
      Inclusion) list as they were not relevant for the Glamsterdam fork

  Fusaka, announcing that EIP-7825 will introduce a per-transaction gas
  limit cap of 2¬≤‚Å¥ (‚âà 16.78 million gas)

## Research

- <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/variants-of-mempool-tickets/23338"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Variants of Mempool
  Tickets</a>- RIG summary of ticketing/lease designs (wholesale,
  leases, simple, loyalty) to bound vertically-sharded blob-mempool
  bandwidth ahead of PeerDAS; implementable via a contract without a
  hard fork.

- <a
  href="https://ethresear.ch/t/nonce-bitmap-enabling-parallel-transaction-submission-for-a-parallel-blockchain/23345"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Nonce Bitmap</a>-
  proposal to allow up to 256 parallel tx per account by reusing nonce
  bits + a bitmap; keeps legacy wallets compatible and targets mempool
  nonce-gap issues

- <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/zkzkevm-private-evm/23315"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">zkzkevm: private
  evm</a>‚Äîintroduces `pload`/`pstore` ops and private state trees on top
  of zkEVM to enable private user-state with EVM compatibility; active
  discussion on co-SNARK/MPC alternatives.

## Layer 2

- **Optimism** released
  <a href="https://www.optimism.io/blog/the-new-optimism-documentation"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">new documentation</a>,
  completely transforming their developer resources to improve the
  onboarding experience for builders on the OP Stack.

## Stuff for Developers

- **Foundry:**

  - Released
    <a href="https://getfoundry.sh/releases/#foundry-v143" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">v1.0.0-rc.3</a> with improved gas
    profiling and better support for the latest EVM features.

- **EIP-8059: Gas Rebase for High-precision Gas Metering** was
  <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10583" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">proposed</a>, offering a new
  approach to gas metering that enables more precise calculations.

- **Contract Bytecode Deduplication Discount**
  <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/10585" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">EIP proposal</a> was submitted,
  aiming to reduce gas costs for contracts that reuse existing bytecode.

## Security

- **Paxos** accidentally
  <a href="https://rekt.news/paxos-300trillion-oopsie" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">minted $300 trillion</a> of PYUSD
  stablecoins (more than 2.5x global GDP)through a single key with
  unlimited minting power. The tokens were burned 22 minutes later,
  raising serious questions about centralized control in regulated
  stablecoins.

- **AWS outage** revealed
  <a href="https://rekt.news/we-have-centralization-issue" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">serious centralization issues</a>
  in crypto infrastructure, affecting Coinbase, MetaMask, and multiple
  L2 networks. While blockchains continued operating, user access was
  severely impacted, highlighting that approximately 37% of Ethereum
  infrastructure relies on Amazon's servers.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

- üö® <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lido at 23.47%</a>, still too close
  to the <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">33.3% threshold</a>.

- Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):

  - Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%

  - Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~42.71% & Prysm ~30.91%

  - Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.

- Better <a href="https://nodewatch.io/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">geographic diversity</a> is
  optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
