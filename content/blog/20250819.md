## Glamsterdam (Amsterdamâ€“G-Star) Upgrade

* The [headliner selection process](https://forkcast.org/upgrade/glamsterdam) has concluded with two major features scheduled for inclusion:
  * [EIP-7732: enshrined Proposer-Builder separation (ePBS)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732) - Decouples consensus block from execution payload to enable L1 scaling
  * [EIP-7928: Block-level Access Lists](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7928) - Introduces access lists at the block level to dramatically reduce gas costs
* [EIP-7805: Fork-Choice Inclusion Lists (FOCIL)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7805) has moved to "Considered" status, which would empower multiple validators to mandate specific transaction inclusion

## Layer 1

* [Integrating 3SF with ePBS, FOCIL, and PeerDAS](https://ethresear.ch/t/integrating-3sf-with-epbs-focil-and-peerdas/22909) - Research on combining three-slot finality with other major protocol improvements
* [Partial history expiry announcement](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/07/08/partial-history-exp) - All Ethereum execution clients now support partial history expiry in accordance with EIP-4444, reducing disk space requirements by 300-500 GB

## Research

## Layer 2

* [USD.AI launches on Arbitrum](https://blog.arbitrum.io/usd-ai-accessible-ai-infra-financing/) to provide financing for AI infrastructure, enabling smaller teams to access expensive GPU resources. The protocol has already reached $50M in TVL during its beta phase and will soon launch on mainnet with pools on Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve.

* [Optimism introduces Kona-Node](https://www.optimism.io/blog/introducing-the-kona-node-a-rust-powered-leap-for-the-op-stack), a Rust-powered rollup node for the OP Stack with enhanced security and performance.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

* ðŸš¨ [Lido at 25.84%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).
