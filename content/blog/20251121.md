## Stuff for Developers

- Foundry released a <a
  href="https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/tag/nightly-229e96959e57cf09b759cf66be8c841780a7e57e"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">nightly update</a>
  with minor fixes including corrected comments for Git functions and
  optimizations for Anvil's internal data handling.

## Security

- Cloudflare experienced a
  <a href="https://rekt.news/when-the-web-goes-dark/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">major outage</a> on November 20
  that took down 20% of the web for 3 hours, including crypto exchanges
  and Twitter. While blockchain networks continued to operate, many
  front-end interfaces were inaccessible, highlighting the irony of
  decentralized protocols relying on centralized infrastructure.

## Ecosystem

- The <a
  href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7928-breakout-7-nov-19-2025/26600"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">EIP-7928 Breakout
  #7</a> meeting was held on November 19, continuing discussions on this
  Ethereum Improvement Proposal.

- A new discussion was started regarding an <a
  href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/open-question-to-the-core-devs-about-eip-7932/26636"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">open question to core
  developers about EIP-7932</a>, seeking clarification on implementation
  details.

## Notable at app layer

- Stream Finance experienced a
  <a href="https://rekt.news/loop-contagion/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">catastrophic failure</a> on
  November 18, with \$93 million vanishing and their stablecoin xUSD
  crashing 77%. The collapse followed October warnings about Stream's 4x
  leverage and recursive loops, resulting in \$285 million in exposure
  being unwound. While Trevee (a related protocol) recovered through
  aggressive action, most depositors face near-total losses.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

- 🚨 <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lido at 23.94%</a>, still too close
  to the <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">33.3% threshold</a>.

- Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):

  - Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%

  - Consensus layer: Lighthouse ~42.71% & Prysm ~30.91%

  - Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.

- Better <a href="https://nodewatch.io/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">geographic diversity</a> is
  optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.

## Client Releases

- **Consensus layer:**

  - <a
    href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lighthouse
    v8.0.1:</a> A hot-fix release correcting several bugs in the v8.0.0
    rollout (including removal of checkpoint-server blob downloads
    pre-Fulu fork, a fix for a custody-context race condition causing
    panics, and preventing unnecessary pre-fork state advances).
