## Layer 1

- <a href="https://gaslimit.pics/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gas limit signalling snapshot</a>:
  Community dashboard shows last update Nov 6 with a 24-hour avg gas
  limit ≈ 45,002,012, i.e., near the current cap, with ongoing validator
  signalling tracked there. Useful context for bandwidth/blob-count
  discussions.

  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">MEV infrastructure reality check:</a>
  Live relay/builder stats this week show continuing concentration among
  a few builders (e.g., Titan, BuilderNet, Quasar), underscoring why
  inclusion-list and PBS discussions remain active.

  MEV</a>: Proposes a “MEV Lock” — a trivial, enshrined-PBS-like design
  that randomly selects 0x03 builder-validators by stake, removes
  proposer↔builder latency, and shifts MEV economics (no bid payments;
  capital cost on builder stake). Requires inclusion lists to counter
  centralization.

## Layer 2

- Starknet rolled out the open-source <a

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

- 🚨 <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lido at 23.57%</a>, still too close
  to the <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">33.3% threshold</a>.

- Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):

  - Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%

  - Consensus layer: Lighthouse 42.71% & Prysm 30.91%

  - Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.

- Better <a href="https://nodewatch.io/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">geographic diversity</a> is
  optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
