## Week in Ethereum News

### November 28, 2025

## Highlight of the Week

- <a
  href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-ethereums-growth-will-be-less-uniform-as-gas-costs-face-targeted-adjustments/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Vitalik Buterin
  proposed a new targeted gas-cost model</a> that could lead to a
  roughly **5× increase in block gas limit for heavy operations** —
  signalling the next wave of scaling ahead of the scheduled Fusaka hard
  fork on December 3.

## Eth R&D Protocol Call(s)

- <a
  href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-170-november-27-2025/26620"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">All Core Devs –
  Consensus (ACDC) #170 (Nov 27, 2025)</a>

  - Fusaka: test status, mainnet plan & incident response

    - Client teams reported successful Fusaka shadow-fork tests, with
      100% participation noted in at least one run, and no new blockers
      flagged at the consensus layer.

    - Agreed to tighten incident-response coordination, with action
      items for client teams to submit PRs clarifying who does what if
      issues arise during the Dec 3 upgrade.

  - Glamsterdam: ePBS progress, devnets & trustless payments

    - Multiple consensus-client teams shared implementation progress on
      enshrined PBS (ePBS, EIP-7732) for Glamsterdam; several are aiming
      for late December or early January devnet testing of their ePBS
      work.

    - Ongoing community questions about trustless payments in ePBS,
      referencing earlier breakout discussions around EIP-7732 variants.

  - FOCIL (EIP-7805) & fork scoping across Glamsterdam and Heka/Bogotá

    - Revisited EIP-7805 (FOCIL) and its role in upcoming forks,
      debating process labels like SFI (Soft For Inclusion) vs CFI
      (Candidate For Inclusion) and how they interact with “headliner”
      vs “non-headliner” features.

    - Agreed to:

      - Treat FOCIL as DFI (Definitely For Inclusion) for Glamsterdam,
        elevating it to a core part of that upgrade’s
        censorship-resistance roadmap.

      - Use CFI (rather than SFI) as the right process label for FOCIL
        in the post-Glamsterdam “H-star” / Heka-Bogotá fork, signalling
        strong interest but leaving room for more testing and spec work.

## Security

- <a href="https://rekt.news/megaoops" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">MegaETH pre-deposit incident</a> -
  A \$250 million pre-deposit imploded into 156 seconds of chaos after
  infrastructure failed, parameters broke, and MegaETH's team collected
  all required multisig signatures too early, resulting in deposits
  reaching \$500 million. No hack occurred - just human error at scale.

- <a href="https://rekt.news/gana-payment-rekt" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GANA Payment exploited</a> - \$3.1
  million was drained from GANA Payment via leaked owner keys and an
  EIP-7702 delegation exploit, just nine days after launch.

## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH

- 🚨 <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Lido at 24.12%</a>, still too close
  to the <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">33.3% threshold</a>.

- Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):

  - Execution layer: Geth ~41% & Nethermind ~38%

  - Consensus layer: Lighthouse 42.71% & Prysm 30.91%

  - Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.

- Better <a href="https://nodewatch.io/" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">geographic diversity</a> is
  optimal, particularly outside of North America & Europe.
